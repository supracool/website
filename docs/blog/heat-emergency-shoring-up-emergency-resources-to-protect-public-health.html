            <div class="u-align-justify u-blog-control u-post-content u-text u-text-2 fr-view"><p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Mar 13, 2023</span></p><p><br></p><p id="isPasted">As temperatures soared across the United States in 2022, more than 140 million Americans in 29 states were under heat alerts. The dangerous heat wave had reached the northeast, and forecasters warned that it could last for six to seven days. It took three days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit for an official heat wave to be declared, and many cities across the country had reached that threshold.</p><p>In Boston, officials had declared a heat emergency, and Philadelphia had extended its heat advisory. With temperatures approaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit in cities like Dallas, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, doctors and public officials urged caution and advised people to stay inside if possible and stay cool. Hydration was also critical during these hot days, as people were at risk of dehydration and heat stroke.</p><p>The power grids in some areas were also under stress due to the high demand for air conditioning, with officials keeping a watchful eye on Texas after the devastating power outages that occurred during the winter storms earlier that year. In New York, Con Edison was sending out alerts to customers to conserve power to prevent outages.</p><p>Unfortunately, the extreme heat had already led to some tragic incidents. In Fort Gordon, Georgia, ten soldiers were struck by lightning during a training exercise, and one of them had died. Additionally, severe turbulence on a flight from Tampa to Nashville resulted in multiple people being hospitalized.</p><p>Heat-related emergencies were on the rise across the country, with hospitals seeing an uptick in heat-related ER visits. Phelps Hospital in Westchester County, New York, had reported a 30 to 40 percent increase in heat-related visits. The heat could exacerbate existing medical conditions, such as heart attacks and strokes, making it critical for people to stay cool and hydrated.</p><p>Experts pointed to climate change as a significant factor in the severity of this heat wave. Climate change had made rare heat waves three to five degrees warmer in much of the United States, and it had doubled the likelihood of record-breaking hot summer days. As temperatures continued to rise, it was crucial for individuals and governments to take action to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p>In the short term, there were steps that individuals could take to stay safe during this heat wave. Staying indoors in air-conditioned spaces was ideal, but if that was not possible, people should try to stay in shaded areas and limit their time outside during the hottest parts of the day. It was also essential to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and to avoid alcohol and caffeine, which could dehydrate the body.</p><p>People should also be aware of the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Symptoms of heat exhaustion included heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and headaches. If left untreated, heat exhaustion could progress to heat stroke, which could be life-threatening. Symptoms of heat stroke included a high body temperature, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures, and a rapid pulse. If someone experienced these symptoms, they should seek medical attention immediately.</p><p>In addition to individual efforts, technology can also play a crucial role in helping people stay cool during extreme heat waves. One such technology is SupraCool, which uses a novel cooling technology to provide rapid and effective relief from heat stress. SupraCool devices can be used in a variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, and emergency response vehicles, to help prevent heat-related emergencies and provide immediate relief to those who are experiencing heat exhaustion or heat stroke. By leveraging innovative technologies like SupraCool, we can better protect ourselves and our communities from the dangers of extreme heat and build a more resilient society.</p><p>The oppressive heat across the United States was a serious concern, with millions of people at risk of heat-related illnesses and emergencies. It was critical for individuals to take precautions to stay cool and hydrated during this heat wave, and for governments to take action to address the root cause of climate change. By working together, we can mitigate the effects of extreme weather events like this and create a safer, more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
